# Multi-Language Application with CI/CD and MSI Deployment

## Project Purpose

This project demonstrates a **multi-language application**, showcasing how to integrate native and managed into a single solution with automated build, test, and deployment.

The project also provides a **CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions** and an **MSI installer (WiX Toolset)** to package and distribute the application.

---

## What It Does?

### Integrates these components into a single WPF application:

- **Fortran**
- **C++ Native**
- **C++/CLI**
- **.NET Framework**
- **.NET Core**
- **WPF (.NET)**

### Includes:

- Unit & UI tests
- Logging in native and managed code
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- MSI installer built with WiX Toolset

## CI/CD Workflow

Fully automated CI/CD pipeline implemented with **GitHub Actions** running on **Windows hosted runners**.

### Pipeline Stages

- **Checkout and restore dependencies**
- **Install Intel OneAPI & WiX Toolset**
- **Build Fortran** (via `devenv`)
- **Build .NET & C++ projects** (via `msbuild`)
- **Run unit tests**
- **Build WPF application**
- **Package everything into an MSI installer and upload it as an artifact**
- **Deploy app on a hosted runner and run UI tests**
- **Upload logs as an artifact**

---

## How Does It Work?

- **Fortran project** is compiled first and produces a DLL used by the WPF application.
- **C++ Native** is compiled as a static `.lib` and linked into **C++/CLI**, which produces a `.dll`.
- **C++/CLI**, **.NET Framework**, and **.NET Core** are referenced in the WPF app.
- **WPF app** integrates all components and provides buttons to invoke each one and display their outputs.
- **Unit tests** (NUnit, Google Test) validate individual components.
- **UI tests** validate the installed application.
- **Logs** from both native (spdlog) and managed (Serilog) components are written to files and uploaded as artifacts.
- **WiX Toolset** packages the WPF executable and its dependencies into an MSI installer.
